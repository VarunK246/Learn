Exploring Github and Git

I have created a branch of my main branch to experiment how the branches work.////

# git add

This adds the files specified to staging area.

Staging area is like a buffer between the changes and commit(typically saving your file).

## Examples

"git add <filename>"
"git add <directory>"

# git commit

This is similar to saving a file.

This is like a buffer between your local system and the remote repo.

## Examples

"git commit" -> prompted for commit message -> Type the message -> Press Enter
"git commit -m "commit message" "
"git commit -a"
