Exploring Github and Git

I have created a branch of my main branch to experiment how the branches work.////

# git add

This adds the files specified to staging area.

Staging area is like a buffer between the changes and commit(typically saving your file).

## Examples

"git add <filename>"
"git add <directory>"
