# Git and GitHub

Exploring Github and Git

I have created a branch of my main branch to experiment how the branches work.////

# git add

This adds the files specified to staging area.

Staging area is like a buffer between the changes and commit(typically saving your file).

## Examples

"git add filename"
"git add directory"

# git commit

This is similar to saving a file.

This is like a buffer between your local system and the remote repo.

## Examples

"git commit" -> Prompted for commit message -> Type the message -> Press Esc -> :wq -> Press Enter

"git commit -m "commit message" "

"git commit -a"

# git diff

This shows all the changes made in the all the files.

## git diff -staged

This shows the difference between the files in the staged area and the recent commit.

## git diff branch1 branch2

This gives the difference between two branches.

# git pull

This pulls the repo with the latest changes made to the remote repo by your teammates.

# git status

This gives you the staged changes and the modified files.

# git show commit_id

This shows the changes made by the specified commit

# git log

This gives the version history of the current branch.

# git checkout

This switches from one branch to another branch.
